## Deep Learning with Keras

This is a website for Deep Learning using <a target="_blank" href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>.

Deep Learning can be a powerful asset for many of the problems faced by
current research and life in general. And Keras is probably the most comprehensive
library for the newcomer in this exciting field.

The material in this website is gathered from a great amount of Internet resources.
It contains ideas from presentation slides, images, source code, etc.
When required, I always cite the relevant resources and point to the people that
should be attributed in each case.
In case that there are any issues regarding the content, please contact me and I
will make sure to properly attribute or (if that is what you require) remove the
content immediately.

Other than the above, feel free to use this website as a tutorial, as a point of
reference, or for any other purpose.

Enjoy Deep Learning and use it responsibly!

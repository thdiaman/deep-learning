# Prerequisites
Starting with Deep Learning and Keras and understanding this tutorial is simple.

## Software Prerequisites
You are going to need a solid python distribution, on top of which to install numpy, scipy,
scikit-learn, matplotlib, and after that you can install Keras by running:

```
pip install keras
```

To avoid any messes, you are definitely recommended to install one of the pre-bundled
python distribitions, such as [WinPython](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.6/3.6.5.0/)
or [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)

I test everything on the version 3.6.3.0 of WinPython with QT5, available
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.6/3.6.3.0/WinPython-64bit-3.6.3.0Qt5.exe) for 64-bit OSes
and [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.6/3.6.3.0/WinPython-32bit-3.6.3.0Qt5.exe/download) for
32-bit OSes.

## Other Prerequisites
In terms of other prerequisites etc., you are advised to have the following:

- some basic knowledge about Machine Learning, and specifically classification, regression, etc.
- some basic understanding of data manipulation in Python (numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- a nice attitude towards learning, because it's going to be fun!

## IDE Prerequisites
As an IDE, you can use anything you want. I use [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/)
for this, which is also preinstalled in the distributions mentioned above.
Having said this, to correctly run all the exampless in Spyder (with IPython), you may
have to select Tools --> Preferences and inside the IPython console and the Graphics tab
set Backend to Automatic. This is shown in the following screenshot:
